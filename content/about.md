# About Duxt

Duxt is a meta-framework built on top of [Jaspr]({{links.jaspr}}), designed to make building full-stack Dart web applications fast and enjoyable.

## Why Duxt?

Building web apps with Dart is powerful, but setting up the project structure, routing, API clients, and state management can be tedious. Duxt provides sensible defaults and conventions so you can focus on building features.

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Fast Development** | Scaffold generators and conventions mean less boilerplate |
| **Type Safety** | Full Dart type safety from frontend to backend |
| **Full Stack** | Build client and server with the same language |
| **Modern Stack** | Tailwind CSS, hot reload, and modern tooling |

## The Stack

- **[Jaspr]({{links.jaspr}})** — The Dart web framework
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** — Utility-first CSS
- **[Dart](https://dart.dev)** — The programming language

## Open Source

Duxt is open source and available on GitHub:
